For now, no makefile. Committing to avoid any trouble due to personal disasters such as hard
disk failure. As of the first commit, the project has a foundation laid, but is otherwise in
a state of total uselessness. Kind of like a house with no walls or doors.

If you wish to build the thing, just install Code::Blocks and open the enclosed .cbp.

Makefile to come with project maturity...

Docs not included because anyone with Doxygen can presently generate them. Perhaps when the
project's size competes with that of its documentation, I will upload them.

In the meantime, work will continue at whatever pace.
